The game console has a "ping pong" game and a "guess the synonym" game. It works using 4 buttons and a buzzer.

##Ping Pong Game

**Instructions**

Game selection and choices selection are using the joystick button. To navigate, use the joystick.
During the ping pong game, if you press the joystick button, it will pause the game status and take you back to the “select game type” screen. To resume the game, select fun again or play an educational game. While playing the ping pong game, the left player uses the joystick to move the paddle and the right player uses the top and bottom buttons.
Now the fun part! As the player’s score increases, their paddle size will decrease to increase the difficulty of the game. The first one to get a perfect 8 wins!
